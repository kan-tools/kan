## Historical record

**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Decision:** `kan context --budget N` estimates tokens via `tiktoken-rs`
(cl100k/o200k BPE), wrapped behind a `TokenEstimator` trait rather than called
directly at use sites.
**Why:** Real BPE tokenization is a meaningfully better estimate than a
chars/4 heuristic, and `tiktoken-rs` is a real, MIT-licensed, usable crate —
confirmed by adding it and building, not just reading its description. It
isn't exact for every model kan might feed (it's OpenAI's encodings), so the
trait boundary keeps the concrete tokenizer swappable later without touching
call sites. Closes Open Question Q2.
