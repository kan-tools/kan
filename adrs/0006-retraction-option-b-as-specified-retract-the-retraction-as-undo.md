## Historical record

**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Decision:** Accepts `docs/SPEC.md` §12.2's recommended default (Option B,
retraction-as-claim/palimpsest) as-is. Undo is retracting the `Retraction`
claim itself — no separate `Restore`/`Unretract` kind.
**Why:** Because superseded claims are excluded from state reduction and
`cites` is strictly backward-only (acyclic CID-DAG), retracting a retraction
naturally un-suppresses the original claim with no special-casing required.
