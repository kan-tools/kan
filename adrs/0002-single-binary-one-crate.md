## Historical record

**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Decision:** `kan` ships as one crate (lib + CLI + `kan mcp` subcommand),
not a Cargo workspace of `kan-core`/`kan-cli`/`kan-mcp`.
**Why:** Matches the local-only "dramatically simpler" smell test in
`CLAUDE.md` — no workspace/versioning ceremony until there's a concrete reason
(e.g. a second consumer of `kan-core`) to split.
