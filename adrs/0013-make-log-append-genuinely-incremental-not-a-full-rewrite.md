## Historical record

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Decision:** Rewrite `Log::append`'s persistence step to write only the
*new* blocks (the new record, whatever `Mst` internal nodes changed along
the insertion path, and the new commit) to the end of the CAR file, instead
of re-serializing everything `mst.storage()` has ever seen. Brings back a
`HEAD` sidecar file (ADR-8's original `atrium-repo` pattern, dropped when
ADR-12 made it briefly unnecessary) since the CAR header's `roots` are still
fixed at file-creation time — `Log` never reads them back; `HEAD` is
authoritative for the current root.
**Why:** ADR-12 shipped O(n)-per-append as a documented, correctness-first
tradeoff (tracked in issue kan-tools/kan#8) rather than something to fix
immediately. Asked directly whether a hybrid was possible: yes.
`atproto-repo`'s `CarWriter` always writes a fresh header at construction
(no public "resume" mode), but `CarBlock::to_bytes()` — the exact
length-prefix + CID + data wire format `atproto_dasl::car`'s module doc
documents — is public. That's enough to append new blocks directly, since
MST is a persistent (not in-place-mutated) structure: an `insert` only
creates new nodes along the path from root to the new leaf, so "new blocks
since last persist" is a small, bounded set, not the whole tree.
**Verification, before trusting hand-rolled low-level byte-writing again:**
- Direct timing: append latency stayed flat (~4-6ms) as the CAR file grew
  from 817 bytes to 229KB across 60 appends — confirms the write cost
  doesn't scale with log size anymore. (`tests/log_stress.rs` itself still
  takes ~6s, but that's ECDSA signature verification in `get()` — ~3ms/call,
  ~1830 calls from the test's own O(n²) reachability checking — not the
  storage layer; confirmed by timing `get()` in isolation.)
- `tests/log_cross_process_stress.rs` (new): a *fresh `Log` instance per
  append* — not one long-lived object appending repeatedly, but the actual
  kan usage pattern of one process per CLI invocation. This is the real risk
  surface for the file-is-new/header-once logic; 50 separate-instance
  appends with full reachability + `iter_all` checks every 10, run 5x with
  no failures during development (1000+ total appends across separate
  instances) before landing at a smaller CI-sized version.
